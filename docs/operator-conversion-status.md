This document is a capability inventory for the current **onnx2webnn** branch. It contains no
implementation phases or rollout plan. The baseline is the 198 non-deprecated standard
`ai.onnx` operator names active at opset 26.

An operator marked implemented has at least one executable form. It does not imply that every
schema revision, attribute combination, data type, rank, optional input/output, or dynamic-shape
form is supported. The scope column records known material restrictions.

## Status categories

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Direct WebNN** | At least one supported form primarily maps to a standardized WebNN builder primitive. |
| **Decomposed** | Executes through multiple WebNN primitives because no matching native primitive exists. |
| **Folded/static** | Resolved or materialized while converting. |
| **Pattern-only** | Executes only when a specific static export pattern can be eliminated or inlined. |
| **Unsupported** | No executable lowering exists on this branch. |

Direct WebNN is the spec-level subset of executable support. Decomposed, folded, and pattern-only
operators execute, but are not native WebNN operator mappings.

### Estimated performance impact

The performance-impact column is populated only for **Decomposed** operators. These estimates are
derived from the current emitted WebNN graph, not from cross-backend benchmarks; actual cost depends
on tensor shapes, backend fusion, memory movement, and hardware.

| Tier | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **minimal** | A small number of cheap elementwise, cast, or shape operations; backend fusion can often remove most overhead. |
| **moderate** | Multiple full-tensor passes, reductions, or materialized intermediates are expected to add noticeable overhead. |
| **high** | The lowering loses a fused, quantized, integer-accumulation, attention, or sparse-dispatch path and can materially increase compute or memory traffic. |
| **not inferred** | Impact varies too strongly with the accepted equation, input count, shape, or backend to estimate from the lowering alone. |

## Coverage

| Opset-26 standard ONNX coverage | Count | Share |
|---------------------------------|------:|------:|
| Total non-deprecated `ai.onnx` names | 198 | 100% |
| **Executable for at least one supported form** | **129** | **65.2%** |
| └ Direct WebNN/spec-level subset | **96** | **48.5%** |
| └ Decomposed, folded, or pattern-only | **33** | **16.7%** |
| Unsupported | 69 | 34.8% |

The 129 executable names comprise 127 standard names advertised by
`scripts/webnn_onnx_ops.py`, plus the narrow registry-only `SplitToSequence` and `SequenceAt`
pattern. The 96 direct names comprise 86 mappings in the pinned `webnn-onnx-utils` name map plus
ten direct handlers not yet mirrored there: `CumSum`, `GatherElements`, `GatherND`, `IsInf`,
`IsNaN`, `LpPool`, `ReverseSequence`, `Round`, `ScatterElements`, and `ScatterND`.

## Additional contrib and fused operators

These eight advertised names are executable but are not standard `ai.onnx` opset-26 names, so
they are excluded from the 198-op percentages.

| Operator | Status | Execution scope and WebNN limitation | Estimated perf impact |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `GatherBlockQuantized` | Decomposed | Gathers packed rows/scales/zero points and dequantizes only the selected slice for supported 2-D axis-0 tables; other layouts fall back at conversion time. | moderate |
| `GroupQueryAttention` | Decomposed | Static attention/cache subgraph. WebNN has no fused attention; runtime sequence metadata is ignored and softcap/local-window modes are rejected. Fused backend kernels and the portable decomposition need not be bit-identical, so an immediately following dynamic quantizer can amplify legal rounding differences. | high |
| `MatMulBnb4` | Decomposed | Packed NF4/FP4 block path where representable; incompatible tails become dense constants, losing low-bit memory/performance benefits. | high |
| `MatMulNBits` | Decomposed | Supported 4/8-bit constant layouts dequantize into a matmul path; g_idx is rejected. WebNN has no low-bit matmul kernel. | high |
| `MoE` | Decomposed | All experts execute densely because WebNN has no TopK or sparse dispatch. Approximate compute overhead is num_experts/k; supported activation/fusion forms only. | high |
| `QMoE` | Decomposed | Supported 4/8-bit expert weights feed the same dense all-expert lowering; block-layout fallbacks may dequantize at conversion time. | high |
| `SimplifiedLayerNormalization` | Decomposed | RMS-style normalization decomposition; no matching WebNN fused primitive. | moderate |
| `SkipSimplifiedLayerNormalization` | Decomposed | Residual/bias plus simplified normalization decomposition; no matching WebNN fused primitive. | moderate |

### MoE interpretation

The previous documentation called MoE impossible because **native sparse MoE execution** cannot be
represented in standard WebNN. That limitation remains. This branch nevertheless executes the
supported `MoE` and `QMoE` forms by evaluating every expert and blending the selected outputs.
This is functional fallback support, not sparse-dispatch performance parity.

## Reproducing the inventory

```bash
python scripts/generate_onnx_opsets.py --min 26 --max 26 -o docs/onnx-opsets
python scripts/onnx_ops_to_csv.py model.onnx --check-webnn
```

Sources of truth: `scripts/webnn_onnx_ops.py`, the handler registry in
`src/onnx/ops/mod.rs`, handler restrictions in `src/onnx/ops/*.rs`, and the opset gate in
`src/onnx/convert.rs`. Numerical model results are tracked separately in
[model-validation-status.md](./model-validation-status.md).
